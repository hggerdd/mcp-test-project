# User Story: Save and Load Data Functionality

## Overview
As a user of the Simple Topics extension, I want to be able to save my entire workspace state (including topics, categories, bookmarks, and open tabs) to a file and later restore it, so that I can backup my work, transfer it to another computer, or restore it after a browser reinstall.

## Core Requirements

### Saving Data
1. When I click the save button in the sidebar, the extension should:
   - Export all my topics and their names
   - Export all categories for each topic
   - Export all bookmarks within each category
   - Export information about all tabs (both visible and hidden)
   - Export which tab belongs to which topic
   - Export the current active topic
   - Save the complete data to a JSON file on my computer

2. The saved data should be complete enough to fully restore my workspace:
   - All tab information must include URLs and topic assignments
   - All bookmarks must maintain their categorization
   - The hierarchical structure (topic → category → bookmark) must be preserved

### Loading Data
1. When I click the load button and select a previously saved file:
   - The extension should ask for confirmation before replacing my current data
   - All topics should be imported with their original names
   - All categories should be restored to their respective topics
   - All bookmarks should be restored to their respective categories
   - All tab-to-topic assignments should be restored

2. For tabs handling:
   - If a tab from the saved data is already open (same URL), it should be assigned to the correct topic
   - The extension should ask if I want to reopen tabs from the saved session that aren't currently open
   - If I choose to reopen tabs, they should be created with the correct URLs and assigned to their original topics
   - Tabs for inactive topics should be hidden immediately after creation (lazy loading)
   - Only tabs belonging to the active topic should be visible after import is complete

3. The import process should be transactional:
   - Either all data is imported successfully, or none of it is (to prevent partial state)
   - After import, the active topic should be set to the same one that was active in the saved data

## Expected Behavior

### During Save
1. When I click the save button, the file download should start immediately
2. The file name should include a timestamp to avoid confusion between different saved states
3. The save operation should not interrupt my current browsing session
4. The extension should notify me when the save is complete

### During Load
1. When I click the load button, a file picker should open
2. After selecting a file, I should see a confirmation dialog before my current data is replaced
3. If the file format is invalid, I should receive a clear error message
4. The extension should show progress or notify me that an import is in progress
5. For tab reopening:
   - I should be asked whether to reopen tabs that aren't currently open
   - Tab reopening should happen in the background (not all tabs activated at once)
   - Tabs should be properly categorized by topic immediately
   - Only tabs for the active topic should be visible
6. After import completes, my workspace should look exactly as it did when I saved it, with:
   - The same active topic
   - The same tabs visible
   - All other tabs correctly hidden but assigned to their topics

## Additional Requirements

1. **Persistence Across Browser Sessions**:
   - Tab assignments must survive browser restarts
   - If I save my state, close the browser, and import the saved state in a new session, all tab-topic relationships should be restored

2. **Tab Identity**:
   - The system must have a way to identify tabs even if they are reloaded or the browser is restarted
   - Tab identification should be based on URL and other metadata to ensure correct matching

3. **Lazy Tab Loading**:
   - When reopening tabs during import, tabs for inactive topics should not be activated
   - Tab creation should be done efficiently to minimize browser strain

4. **Complete Tab Information**:
   - The saved data must contain enough information to restore tab-topic relationships
   - If a tab cannot be found, the system must be able to recreate it with its URL

5. **Format Compatibility**:
   - The system should handle different versions of the saved data format
   - Older saved files without complete tab information should still work, but with limited tab restoration

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - Export/import should handle workspaces with many tabs (50+) efficiently
   - The operation should not freeze the browser during processing

2. **Storage Efficiency**:
   - The saved JSON file should be reasonably sized
   - Only essential data should be included in the export

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The system should provide clear feedback if an export or import fails
   - Any errors during tab reopening should be logged but not block the overall import process

4. **User Control**:
   - Users should be able to choose whether to reopen tabs
   - The system should provide clear information about what is happening

## Out of Scope

1. Synchronization with cloud storage
2. Automatic backups/saves
3. Partial imports (e.g., only topics but not tabs)
4. Merging data from multiple saved files
